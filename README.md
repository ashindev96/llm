# Text Classification with DistilBERT

This repository provides the detailed manual and the code for the text classification procedure by using the DistilBERT model which is the BERT model with less parameters. The project takes the viewer through all the basic steps that are related to text data preparation, training a deep learning model, the modelâ€™s assessment, and result visualization.

## Introduction

Dubbed as text categorisation, it is a core NLP activity that has several uses such as sentiment classification, filter, or spam detection, or topical categorisation. This project illustrates how to apply one of the latest models available in the transformer library, the so-called DistilBERT, to text classification.

DistilBERT is a lighter version of BERT that has been achieved by maintaining 97% of the functionality of BERT with enhanced speeds at 60% greater speed and uses only 40% of the BERT parameters. This makes it especially suitable for those projects which need fast text data processing, though maintaining reasonable accuracy at the same time.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the project, ensure you have a basic understanding of the following concepts:Before diving into the project, ensure you have a basic understanding of the following concepts:
- Python programming
- Natural Language Processing or neatly referred to as NLP
- Supervised Machine Learning Specifically
- The deep learning frameworks where one can work in either TensorFlow or PyTorch

Some background information that is helpful consists of previous experience working with Jupyter notebooks and the Hugging Face `transformers` library.

## Installation

To replicate the environment used for this project, follow the steps below:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
```

### Step 2: Install Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Download NLTK Data

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('wordnet')
```

## Data Loading

The dataset is loaded from the Hugging Face dataset gallery by using datasets library which automatically downloads it, caches it and splits it into the train and test datasets.

## Data Exploration and Preprocessing

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involves inspecting the label distribution, the length distribution of texts, and common words, by means of bar plots and word clouds, among others.

### Text Preprocessing

Text data is preprocessed to remove noise and make it suitable for the model to be fed with. Pre-processing includes step of lowercasing, punctuation removal, tokenization, stopword removal and lemmatization.

### Tokenization

Tokenization is done using the Hugging Face `transformers` library tokenizer which prepares the input as the input IDs, attention masks and token type IDs required by the model as input.


## Model Architecture

For sequence classification we use DistilBERT which is a smaller model than BERT. Basically, it is trained for the task of text classification to identify the right label of the sequences in the input.

## Training the Model

The text data is used to train the model preprocessed and with proper tuning of hyperparameters to include but not limited to learning rate, batch size, and the number of epochs to improve the efficiency of the model.

## Evaluation Metrics

The performance which is evaluated in order to understand the result of the model for unseen data is accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

## Model Performance and Analysis

Some of the reasons are confusion matrix for frequent misclassification, precision, recall and F1-score for evaluating the model, and learning curves to gain an understanding of the training session.

## Visualizations

Other visualizations include the word clouds, word frequency plots, label distribution plots, learning curves gleaned from the Model Visualization.

## Challenges and Considerations

Some issues considered in the project are linked to computational resources, data imbalance, and overfitting solutions for which strategies suggested are data augmentation, hyperparameter optimization, and regularization.

## Conclusion

This project shows the implementation of a DistilBERT, which is one of the most accurate transformer models at the present time, to a text classification task. The work encompasses data pre-processing, model training, and evaluation along with visualizations making it a tutorial-style guide to text classification using the contemporary approach of NLP.

## Future Work

Enhancements which could come in future include fine-tuning of the hyperparameters, data augmentation, multiple models and incorporating the model in a production environment.
